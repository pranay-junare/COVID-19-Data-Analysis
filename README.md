# COVID-19-Data-Analysis


## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The novel respiratory infection disease we are collectively battling emerged last year in China and although it is still unknown exactly where the outbreak first started, many early cases of COVID-19 have been attributed to people who have visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, located in Wuhan, Hubei, China.

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster. Of the early cluster of cases reported that month, two thirds were found to have a link with the market.

The purpose of this work is :
- To tell the story of how the struggle of the people with an mysterious virus that has claimed millions of human lives all over the world is going on.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and provide meaningful insights.
- Build a Machine Learing Model to predict the new cases during the Second wave of Coronavirus.
- Build a Basic COVID-19 Dashboard to try and presesnt your work in an Interactive way.

## Jupyter Notebook
Please view the Notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/pranayjunare/new-zealand-model) since Github does not render plotly graphs because it performs a static render of the notebooks and it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.
